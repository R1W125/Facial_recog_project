# Facial_recog_project
This is my first trial playing around with the facial recognition library in python
I created a program that detects known faces and sends an email when the similarity index is over 50%
I use face encodings to compare known and lice faces
I also use cv2 to capture video and show a live image with the identification and similarity index (reversed to get percentage)

In order to make it easy to run on all devices, I use a virtual environment to run the program
I want to eventually containerize this instead of using a venv
